  This is a package of platform-independent data in multiple
  formats derived from the Pleiades gazetteer of ancient
  places. It is used for archival and redistribution
  purposes and is likely to be less up-to-date than the live
  data at https://pleiades.stoa.org.

  "#insert-releasenotes#

  Pleiades is a community-built gazetteer and graph of
  ancient places. It publishes authoritative information
  about ancient places and spaces, providing unique services
  for finding, displaying, and reusing that information
  under open license. It publishes not just for individual
  human users, but also for search engines and for the
  widening array of computational research and visualization
  tools that support humanities teaching and research.

  Pleiades is a continuously published scholarly reference
  work for the 21st century. We embrace the new paradigm of
  citizen humanities, encouraging contributions from any
  knowledgeable person and doing so in a context of
  pervasive peer review. Pleiades welcomes your
  contribution, no matter how small, and we have a number of
  useful tasks suitable for volunteers of every interest.
