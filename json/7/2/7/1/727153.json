    "description": "Mareia is a Late Antique settlement in Egypt, with remains of harbor and industrial installations, baths, shops, a funerary church, and a large basilica.",
    "details": "\r\n<p class=\"MsoNoSpacing\">Marea is located <em>ca.</em>45 km to\r\nthe southwest of Alexandria, along the south shore of Lake Maryut. The \r\narea\r\nwhere most of the ruins were identified is bounded on the north and east\r\n by\r\nwater and on the west by a modern road leading to the Alexandria-Siwa \r\nhighway.\r\nTo the south lies the modern village of Hawariyyah.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNoSpacing\">Marea was strategically placed in an\r\narea famous in antiquity for trade and wine production. Indeed, \r\nconsiderable\r\nevidence of industrial installations such as wine presses was found in \r\nthe\r\nregion, testifying to a thriving economy based on agricultural \r\nexploitation and\r\ncommerce. Canals connected Lake Maryut with the Nile River, which not \r\nonly\r\nsupplied fresh water to the lake but–quite significantly–allowed the\r\ntransportation of goods from the Valley to Alexandria and the south-west\r\nMediterranean region.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNoSpacing\">Considerable questions were raised\r\nby scholars about the identification of this site as the Marea mentioned\r\n in the\r\nhistorical sources, such as Herodotus. These provide evidence for the \r\nexistence\r\nof the town (an important commercial and military post) well before the\r\nfifth-sixth century CE, which was considered–for a long time–the \r\nearliest\r\ndating offered by the archaeological data. For this reason, an \r\nalternative\r\nidentification of the site was offered, according to which the ruins \r\nbelonged\r\nto the late fifth century site of Philoxenite. The settlement was \r\nfounded by\r\nPhiloxenos, prefect of the emperor Anastasius, to provide accommodation \r\nand\r\nfacilities to the disembarking pilgrims who were on their journey to Abu\r\n Mina.\r\nHowever, recent excavations allowed the discovery of evidence pointing \r\nto\r\nearlier occupational phases than the fifth-sixth century. The complete \r\nlack of\r\nglazed pottery on site suggests a date for its abandonment at the end of\r\n the\r\neighth century, although the sources testify to an occupational history\r\nextending to at least the end of the fourteenth century.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNoSpacing\">Information about the site was\r\nrecorded since the end of the nineteenth century, but the first \r\nscientific\r\nexcavations of the site were conducted by F. el-Fakharani of the \r\nUniversity of\r\nAlexandria–and by a Boston University team–in the late 1970s to the \r\nearly\r\n1980s. More recently, the site of Marea was the object of a Polish \r\nexcavation\r\nproject (still undergoing), under the direction of H. Szymańska. Since\r\n2003, a peninsula about 100 m to the northeast of the town has been \r\nsurveyed\r\nand excavated by the Centre d’Etudes Alexandrines.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNoSpacing\">Most of the visible <a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/isawnyu/5202751666/\">remains</a> are\r\nscattered on the shore and in the proximities of the harbor, which is \r\ndivided\r\ninto separate basins by four stone jetties (whose length extends up to \r\n150 m <em>ca.</em>).\r\nThe earlier excavations revealed the existence of two main street axes, \r\nthe <em>cardo</em>\r\nand the <em>decumanus</em>, and of several buildings, including shops or \r\nlaboratories–furnished\r\nwith back rooms possibly for domestic purposes–opening onto a colonnade.\r\n The\r\nremains of an industrial installation (a press) were found to the east \r\nof the\r\nshops. To the west of the latter, el-Fakharani discovered double-bath\r\ninstallations. The buildings are symmetrically built and once provided \r\nseparate\r\nfacilities for men and women, including two double-apse <em>apodyteria</em>.\r\nRooms were vaulted and had walls and floors covered with marble tiles,\r\nproviding evidence for the existence of a wealthy community at Marea in\r\nByzantine times.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNoSpacing\">Another double-bath <a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/isawnyu/5202155889/\">complex</a>, dated\r\nto the sixth century, was discovered by the Polish mission about 300 m \r\nsouth of\r\nthe lake’s shore. It also consists of distinct facilities for men and \r\nwomen and\r\nbears evidence for water-heating installations. The baths were once \r\nrichly\r\ndecorated with marble slabs and columns. Outside the north wall of the \r\ncomplex\r\nare the remains of shops and a latrine. Evidence was also found for the \r\nsystem\r\nthat supplied water to the baths. About five meters to the north of the \r\ncomplex\r\nare the substantial remains of a deep well, from which the water was \r\nraised\r\nthrough a <em>saqiyah</em> before being channeled to the baths.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNoSpacing\">A funerary <a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/isawnyu/5202157025/\">chapel</a> was excavated 110\r\nm <em>ca.</em> to the southeast of the bath and well complex. It is a \r\nrectangular\r\nbuilding measuring 9 by 7.70 m, with a small apse oriented to the east \r\n(ENE).\r\nSix small rectangular rooms, three of which with well-preserved stairs, \r\nare\r\nlined up along the east wall of the chapel. More to the west, are three \r\nlarger\r\nspaces once functioning as grave chambers, in which several bodies were \r\nfound\r\nin very disturbed contexts. The entrance is located in the middle of the\r\n west\r\nwall and leads into a vestibule, where the scanty remains of a centrally\r\n placed\r\nstaircase are visible. The funerary chapel was dated by its excavators \r\nto the\r\nsixth century, on the basis of ceramic evidence found under the apse.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNoSpacing\">Particularly impressive are the\r\nremains of a large sixth-century <a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/isawnyu/5202750866/in/set-72157625455716154/\">basilica</a> with transept, located in the\r\nproximities of the longest preserved pier of the harbor. The basilica \r\nwas first\r\ndiscovered in the 1960s by W. Müller-Wiener, who carried out excavations\r\n at the\r\nsite of Deir Abu Mina. In the 1980s, it was partially investigated by P.\r\nGrossmann, who also published the complete plan of the building. The \r\nPolish\r\nmission conducted intensive excavations in the area of the basilica \r\nsince 2003,\r\noffering considerable evidence for different phases of construction \r\nand–quite\r\nsignificantly–of occupation of the site before the fifth-sixth century.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNoSpacing\">The basilica, whose entrance is\r\nlocated at the center of the west wall, is oriented to the east (ENE), \r\nwhere it\r\nends into a relatively small apse. The building measures 49 m in length \r\nand 47\r\nm in width, including the double-apse transept. Two rows of columns \r\ndivide the\r\nmain body of the basilica into a nave and two side aisles and continue \r\nalong\r\nthe inner walls of the transept. The columns create an ambulatory \r\nrunning\r\naround the building except for its west end, which does not have a \r\nreturn\r\naisle. Although the basilica does not have <em>pastophoria</em> flanking \r\nthe\r\napse, two small rooms are symmetrically placed inside the transept, \r\npossibly as\r\nlater additions. Two rectangular openings pierce the floor of the apse \r\nand lead\r\nto underground chambers, where several bodies were found. Remains of a \r\nround\r\nbaptistery with side steps are visible west of the central apse, but \r\nthey\r\nbelong to a pre-existing church or chapel. There is substantial \r\narchaeological\r\nevidence to indicate that the interior of the basilica was once richly \r\ndecorated\r\nwith marble columns and wall mosaics.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNoSpacing\">Along the outer face of the church’s\r\nnorth wall, the excavators found remains of a small chapel and a row of\r\nrectangular rooms to the north of it. Other features include a latrine\r\nuncovered to the west of the church. Against the outer walls of the east\r\n apse\r\nand the transept are buttresses that may have been built at a later \r\nstage to\r\nsupport the building. Excavations carried out in the area of the \r\n<a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/isawnyu/5202751066/in/set-72157625455716154/\">apse</a>–below\r\nfloor level–revealed a pottery <a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/isawnyu/5202155575/in/set-72157625455716154/\">kiln</a> with <em>amphorae</em> dated to the\r\nsecond-third c. CE, whose discovery allowed a re-evaluation of the \r\nsite’s\r\nchronology.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNoSpacing\">Scattered in the area south of Marea\r\nare substantial remains of industrial installations–such as <a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/isawnyu/5202155025/in/set-72157625455716154/\">wine \r\npresses</a>–and an\r\nunusual building complex. Its most significant features are two large \r\nperystyle\r\n<a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/isawnyu/5202156171/\">courtyards</a>, which once gave access to several rooms built along their \r\nsides. A\r\n<a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/isawnyu/5202156327/in/set-72157625455716154/\">chapel</a>, with traces of a beautiful <em>opus sectile</em> floor, and a \r\ncommunal\r\n<a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/isawnyu/5202156841/in/set-72157625455716154/\">latrine</a> are also part of the complex, which may have been in use as a \r\nhostel\r\nfor travelers.</p>\r\n<p align=\"right\" class=\"MsoNoSpacing\">Nicola Aravecchia</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNoSpacing\">&nbsp;<strong>SELECTED BIBLIOGRAPHY</strong><strong>:</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNoSpacing\">Abd el-Fattah,\r\n A.
