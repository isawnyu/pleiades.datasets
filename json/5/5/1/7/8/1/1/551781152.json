    "description": "Roman/late antique settlement, with visible remains of streets and mud-brick structures, including a church, two pigeon towers, and possibly residential units. Largely unexcavated.",
    "details": "Ain el-Sabil is located in the <a class=\"external-link\" href=\"../776172\">Dakhla Oasis</a> of Upper\r\nEgypt, 2.5 km southeast of the village of Ismant and less than 1.5 km southwest\r\nof the archaeological site of <a class=\"external-link\" href=\"../776189/\">Kellis</a>/<a class=\"external-link\" href=\"../776189\">Ismant el-Kharab</a>.\r\n<p class=\"MsoNoSpacing\">The <a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/isawnyu/5218025103/in/set-72157625494063982/\">site</a> extends up to 390 m from east to west and up\r\nto 220 m from north to south. Although its original extent is unknown, it does\r\nnot seem to have been a significantly large settlement, especially in\r\ncomparison with the neighboring village of Kellis. Ain el-Sabil is currently\r\ndelimited to the north, east, south, and west by cultivated fields, which are\r\ndangerously encroaching upon the archaeological area.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNoSpacing\">The Dakhleh Oasis Project conducted a preliminary\r\nsurvey of the area in 1980. The site remained unexcavated until 2009, when an\r\nEgyptian mission of the local Coptic and Islamic Inspectorate, under the\r\ndirection of Kamel Bayoumi, started digging in the <a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/isawnyu/5218615064/in/set-72157625494063982/\">southeast sector</a> of the\r\nsite. Investigation was conducted inside a few barrel-vaulted mud-brick rooms,\r\nwhich may have belonged to a domestic unit. Among the registered finds were\r\nseveral coins and Greek ostraka. A preliminary reading and analysis of the\r\nlatter, carried out by Roger Bagnall and Rodney Ast, point to a fourth-century dating, which\r\nseems confirmed by considerable ceramic evidence scattered throughout the site.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNoSpacing\">In close proximity to the excavated area, the Egyptian\r\nteam found a large structure undoubtedly identifiable as a church. Although not\r\nyet excavated, the building has a clearly discernible layout. The church is oriented\r\nto the east and has a basilical plan, consisting of a central nave and two side\r\naisles. These are defined by two rows of mud-brick columns, which are\r\npreserved to their full height. The apse is rectangular in shape and is framed\r\nby two semi-columns. An arched niche is set into the sanctuary’s north and\r\nsouth walls, which open onto side <em>pastophoria</em>\r\nthrough small doorways. The church of Ain el-Sabil, the dating of which is yet\r\nunknown, seems to share some typological similarities with the Large East\r\nChurch at Kellis.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNoSpacing\">Other visible remains –although unexcavated–\r\ninclude two main streets, running from northwest to southeast, large open spaces,\r\nand numerous clusters of mud-brick <a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/isawnyu/5218027739/in/set-72157625494063982/\">buildings</a> of undetermined nature. Most rooms\r\nbear substantial traces of barrel-vaulted ceilings and rectangular or arched\r\nniches piercing the walls. These openings are often surrounded by rectangular\r\nbands of white gypsum plaster, following a decorative standard common to most\r\nsites in the oasis throughout antiquity.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNoSpacing\">Standing several meters above ground level are the\r\nremains of two mud-brick towers. The better preserved <a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/isawnyu/5218613750/in/set-72157625494063982/\">one</a> is located in the\r\nsoutheast sector of the site and consists of two rectangular rooms parallel to\r\neach other. Traces of barrel vaults and rows of square holes, piercing some of\r\nthe walls, are still visible inside. The <a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/isawnyu/5218026565/in/set-72157625494063982/\">second tower</a> is located about 70 m to\r\nthe north. Only scanty remains of its walls, though standing at a considerable\r\nheight, can be seen. Comparative analysis with similar buildings suggests an\r\nidentification of both structures as pigeon towers, a typical feature of the\r\noasis’ landscape in Roman times and during Late Antiquity.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNoSpacing\">The close proximity of Ain el-Sabil to Kellis, their\r\napparently similar chronology, and documentary evidence retrieved at Ain el-Sabil\r\nsuggest that ties existed between the two settlements. Ain el-Sabil may indeed have\r\nbeen a small rural center economically and administratively dependent on the\r\nlarger village of Kellis, as may have been the case for the site of <a class=\"external-link\" href=\"../861854258\">Ain\r\nel-Gedida</a>.</p>\r\n<p align=\"right\" style=\"text-align: right;\" class=\"MsoNoSpacing\">Nicola Aravecchia</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNoSpacing\"><strong>SELECTED BIBLIOGRAPHY</strong><strong>:</strong></p>\r\n[No available publications.]",
