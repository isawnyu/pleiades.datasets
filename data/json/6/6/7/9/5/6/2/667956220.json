    "description": "Late antique settlement, possibly monastic, with substantial remains of a church, mud-brick structures, and tombs.",
    "details": "Deir Abu Matta is located in the Dakhla Oasis of Upper\r\nEgypt, <em>ca.</em> 8 km southeast of the town\r\nof El-Qasr and <em>ca.</em> 6 km southeast of\r\nthe archaeological site of <a class=\"external-link\" href=\"../776235\">Amheida (ancient Trimithis)</a>. The area of the visible\r\narchaeological remains is fairly limited and is surrounded to the north, west,\r\nand east by some desertic land, habitations, and cultivated fields, and to the\r\nsoutheast by a paved road.\r\n<p class=\"MsoNoSpacing\">In 1908, H. E. Winlock briefly recorded and\r\nphotographed the site of Deir Abu Matta during his trip from Kharga to Dakhla. In\r\n1980, D.O.P. members surveyed the mound atop which the church is located and\r\ncarried out test trenching inside the basilica. An archaeological project\r\ninvolving the investigation and documentation of the church and adjacent\r\nstructures began at the end of 2007, under the direction of Gillian Bowen. Full\r\nexcavation started in 2008.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNoSpacing\">The <a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/isawnyu/4545335337/in/set-72157623791605389/\"><strong>church</strong></a> is the largest visible building of the site.\r\nIt is oriented east-west and is rectangular in shape, measuring <em>ca.</em> 24 m east-west by 10.35 m\r\nnorth-south. The mud-brick <a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/isawnyu/4545967726/in/set-72157623791605389/\"><strong>walls</strong></a> are over 1 m thick and are still standing\r\nseveral meters above ground level. They were built in sections and originally\r\nsupported a beamed roof, as suggested by holes piercing the south wall. A\r\n<a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/isawnyu/4545334547/in/set-72157623791605389/\"><strong>triconch</strong></a>, whose entrance is framed by two engaged pillars, is set inside the\r\nchurch along its east wall. To the sides of the lateral conches, against the\r\nnortheast and southeast corners of the building, are L-shaped <em>pastophoria</em>. According to Grossmann’s\r\nplan, the church was originally divided into a nave and two side aisles by two\r\nrows of six square pillars, with an additional L-shaped pillar at the west end.\r\nA return aisle along the west side of the building joined the two colonnades by\r\nmeans of two square pillars, forming an ambulatory around the central nave. A <em>mastaba</em> is still visible against the\r\nnorthern section of the west wall. Another bench –no longer preserved– was once\r\nlocated against the south wall. Evidence of a relatively narrow door –possibly\r\na secondary entrance into the church– was detected toward the west end of the\r\nnorth wall. The main doorway may have been placed along the west wall.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNoSpacing\">Test trenches were dug along the north wall of the\r\nchurch between 1979 and 1980 and then in 2008. These revealed numerous early\r\nChristian burials, although some of them, at least those excavated more\r\nrecently, were found to have been disturbed.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNoSpacing\">Considerable evidence of different construction phases\r\nin the area of the church was documented since 2008. Architectural features\r\npredating the construction of the basilica are visible to the north of it,\r\npossibly extending further south. Other walls, later than the church according\r\nto the excavators, were found to the north and to the west. A wide, tower-like\r\nbuilding was also excavated to the west of the basilica. It is possible that at\r\nleast some of the structures excavated in the proximity of the church were associated\r\nwith a small-scale monastic establishment, whose existence in Late Antiquity is\r\nsuggested by the modern name of the site (also known as Deir al-Saba Banat, “Monastery\r\nof the Seven Virgins”, following Cassandra Vivian).</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNoSpacing\">According to the D.O.P. report, fifth-century coins\r\nand ceramics datable from the fifth to the seventh century were collected\r\nduring the survey and the test excavation. The finds collected during the\r\n2008-2009 seasons, which include coins, ceramics, and an ostrakon, were all\r\ndated to the fourth/fifth century CE, with no evidence from earlier or later\r\ncenturies. Hence, it is possible that the church of Deir Abu Matta was\r\nconstructed a few centuries earlier than previously thought, roughly at the\r\nsame time when several other churches were built in Dakhla, such as at Kellis\r\nand Ain el-Gedida.</p>\r\n<p align=\"right\" style=\"text-align: right;\" class=\"MsoNoSpacing\">Nicola Aravecchia</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNoSpacing\"><strong>&nbsp;SELECTED\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHY:</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNoSpacing\">Bowen, Gillian E.
